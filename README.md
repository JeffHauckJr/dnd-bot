# dnd-bot

#### 5th Edition D&D bot Is a bot where I utilized the Discord.js Library to help groups save time when setting up for campaigns. Using Node.js and a public api, I was able to make this happen
```
~ commands || This will pull up a Message Embed listing all available commands.
```

#### The Dungeon Master bot's first function allows a user to look up basic Races and get information on them

```
~ Race [race name]
```

#### Another Command we have here allows a user to search classes to gain information.

```
! Class [class name]
```

#### Next up is my personal favorite, the spell command. This allows the user to look up spells by name

```
! Spell [spell name]
```

#### Our Equipment command is another way to help cut prep time before a session. This also will cut down search time for both players and the DM.

```
! equipment [equipment name]
```
