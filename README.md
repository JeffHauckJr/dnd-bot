# Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Dungeon Master Bot

#### 5th Edition D&D bot Is a project where I utilized the Discord.js Library to help groups save time when setting up for campaigns. Using Node.js and a public api, I was able to make this happen
```

#### The Dungeon Master bot's first function allows a user to look up basic Races and get information on them

```
~ Race [race name]
```
![race](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/770968803717939201/885583085024972830/dnd-race.PNG)

#### Another Command we have here allows a user to search classes to gain information.

```
~ Class [class name]
```
![class](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/770968803717939201/885583419889815602/dnd-class.PNG)

#### Next up is my personal favorite, the spell command. This allows the user to look up spells by name

```
~ Spell [spell name]
```
![spell](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/770968803717939201/885583836832993280/dnd-spell.PNG)

#### Our Equipment command is another way to help cut prep time before a session. This also will cut down search time for both players and the DM.

```
~ equipment [equipment name]
```
![equipment](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/770968803717939201/885584279273365554/dnd-equip.PNG)

#### Having an API where you can look up details about a monster really will cut down time for DM's 

```
~ monster [monster name]
```
![monster](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/770968803717939201/885584877431431208/dnd-monster.PNG)

#### Players having questions about class features is a very common thing in my experience. This command will solve that.

```
~ classFeat [class feat name]
```
![classfeat](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/770968803717939201/885585254709067806/dnd-classfeat.PNG)

#### Our Rules command will be able to squash a lot of time between players arguing over their interpretation of the rules.

```
~ rules *List of Rules*   ~ rules [rule name]
```
![rules](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/770968803717939201/885586134862815232/dnd-rules.PNG)![rules1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/770968803717939201/885586168333340742/dnd-rules.PNG)

#### The school of magic command is there for general question about spellcasting schools.

```
~ magic *list of schools*  ~magic [school name]
```
![magic](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/770968803717939201/885586970586284083/dnd-magic.PNG)

#### The dice roll command is simple and always necessary

```
~ roll [number of dice 1-9][die 1-100]
```
